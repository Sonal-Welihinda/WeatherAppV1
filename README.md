# WeatherAppV1

# This is Weather Application that shows weather with the city code using OpenWeather RestfulAPI. I have used html, css and javascript. If you are planning to use this application, you need API key from OpenWeather API and then you need to create a creds.js and inside that file have the variable 'apiKeyWeather'.

## Here are some images of the interface.
